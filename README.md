# Python for Data Visualization — Matplotlib & Seaborn

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in **Python data visualization**, focusing on building clear, informative, and reproducible visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

The project is based on a guided Coursera course and reflects my continuous effort to strengthen foundational data science skills through practical experimentation and structured notebooks.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and apply core visualization techniques commonly used in exploratory data analysis (EDA). Using real-world datasets, I created a variety of plots to understand trends, distributions, and relationships within data.

The work is organized into progressive Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a specific visualization concept.
